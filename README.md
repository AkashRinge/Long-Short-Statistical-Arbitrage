#### We will be using git to collaborate on this project. Please go through the following details very carefully before you start working on this project

## GIT related stuff
Try using GPT to get a basic tutorial on git. We are not getting crazy with git related stuff just the basics is all that is required. The reason I am using GIT is because it will massively help with the collaboration and we can individually work on our parts without relying on others in the team. The most common commands that we will be using are git branch, git checkout branch_name, git commit -m "message", git push origin <branch-name>.
1. Clone this repository to your workplace folder and make sure that you have the master branch. Use cmd > git bash. DO NOT download as zip and extract.
2. Create a new branch for your work. For eg: if your name is Ananya branch should be feature/Ananya. DO NOT forget to switch to your branch locally. DO NOT work on the master branch directly
3. Make changes in the ipynb file in your branch on your computer locally and commit them using git commit -m "message". Please make sure the message is short and sweet yet contains the most important characteristics of the change you made. 
4. Push the changes using git push to your branch. Once you are ready with your change create a pull request from your branch to master. Create a write up of the changes you made. We will do peer review with the team and after resolving comments we can merge your changes into the main project (master branch).
